<h1>English-Like Word Generator</h1>
<p>This Python script generates random words that sound like English words. It uses a corpus of English text to calculate the frequency of each letter and syllable length. Then, it generates random words based on these frequency distributions.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Syllable Counting:</strong> The script includes a function to count the number of syllables in a word.</li>
  <li><strong>Frequency Calculation:</strong> The script calculates the frequency of each letter pair and syllable length in the corpus.</li>
  <li><strong>Random Word Generation:</strong> The script generates random words based on the calculated frequency distributions. Each word is composed of one or more syllables, and each syllable consists of an onset, a nucleus (vowel), and a coda.</li>
  <li><strong>Unpronounceable Sequence Avoidance:</strong> The script includes a mechanism to avoid generating unpronounceable sequences of letters.</li>
